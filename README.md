Author:Sai Sai

Description:
This project is a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Tkinter.
It's contains a simple game menu and you can open and play Tic Tac Toe.
The game allows two players to play on a 3×3 grid, shows the winner, detects draws, and allows restarting the game.
More games can be added later (like Snake & Ladder).

Purposr of the program:
The goal of this project is to create a complete Python application that demonstrates:
GUI programming (Tkinter canvas)
Clean function decomposition
Use of data structures (lists, sets, tuples, dicts)
Reading/writing logs to external files
Using a simple API
Proper error handling and input validation
Git workflow with atomic commits

Todolist:
. need to change about design and GUI a little
. need to make more looking good and fix game structure 
/ Not finish yet, so still need to do more.
